##

A rubygem to download the audio stream of any kind of youtube video without constraint.
It will bypass copyright restrictions, VEVO accounts...

## Install
gem install ytsongdw

## Commands
Download a song by name into folder '~/Music/'<br/>
`ytsongdw 'Titanic Song'`<br/>
Download from a youtube link into folder '~/songs/'<br/>
`ytsongdw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM7SZ5SBzyY ~/songs/`<br/>
<br/>
Download all songs in a youtube playlist<br/>
`ytsongdw https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9B23A78D3D249A74`<br/>
Download multiple songs from a file containing several youtube urls, song names or playlist urls (one per line). Basically all the above options in a `.txt` file<br/>
`ytsongdw songs.txt`<br/>
<br/>
By default all the .m4a files will be stored into the folder named "~/Music/" (will be created if it doesn't exist). You can change the folder name by passing a second argument to the command line as shown in the second example above. DO NOT FORGET the endind '/' on the folder name, or else it will be treated as a filename prefix instead of a folder path.
